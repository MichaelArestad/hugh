# Hugh

Meet Hugh. Hugh allows anyone on the web to change the colors of your site. Permanently... At least until the next person comes along and changes your site's colors.

### Usage

After you install the plugin and activate it, simply add the Hugh color widget to one of your widget areas.

### Caution!

Hugh is not a plugin you should use if you're interested in customizing the colors of your site. Hugh is a plugin you should use if you're interested in letting **everyone** customize the colors of your site.
