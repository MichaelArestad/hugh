Hugh is your personal color consultant. However, Hugh also easily gives in to peer pressure.

== Description ==

Hugh is a widget that will let visitors to your website change the color
scheme, and then push out their new color scheme to everyone else who
happens to be viewing your site at that time.  There is a history of recent
colors, and visitors can even get into 'color battles' fighting over who
gets to determine the color scheme.

== Changelog ==

= 1.0.3 =
* Add `limit` parameter support to the `colors` endpoint.

= 1.0.2 =
* Add support for Twenty Seventeen.

= 1.0.1 =
* Minor tidying. Updated button text, added some missing i18n function calls.

= 1.0 =
* Initial Release.
